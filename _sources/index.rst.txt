    The image below was extracted using the SNOW algorithm from PoreSpy,
    then imported into OpenPNM for use, then exported to Paraview for
    visualization.

*OpenPNM* is an open source project to provide porous media researchers
with a ready-made framework for performing a wide range of pore network
simulations.

Highly customizable
###################

*OpenPNM* is highly customizable, meaning that you can customize it almost
at every level. Usually, it's sufficient to use of our built-in classes,
and customize it by adding your own models. However, if need be, you can
write your own *Network*, *Geometry*, *Phase*, *Physics*, and *Algorithm*
from scratch easily by using our generic classes.

Rich IO ecosystem
#################
If you already have a network model in a typical file format, but want to
use OpenPNM to perform simulations, that's not a problem! OpenPNM supports
a wide variety of :mod:`~openpnm.io` file formats to import from and export
to such as :class:`~openpnm.io.Statoil`, :class:`~openpnm.io.NetworkX`,
etc.
